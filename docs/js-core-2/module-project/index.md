## Overview

CYF Learning Lab - Coworker Discovery Tools

An organisation wants to help its members connect with each other more easily. The tools you'll build will enable members to discover where their colleagues work, what they do, and how to contact them.

## Requirements

Go to the [Learning Lab](https://cyf.act.cool/courses/js2/sprint-1) and work through Sprint 1. This simulated project will introduce you to Agile working practices and roles.

## Iteration

(More sprints to be enabled! This is MVP)

## Delivery

When you have completed your simulated project, discuss what you have learned in your class channel. How did this project develop your understanding of Agile? How will you work together with other developers in the future?
