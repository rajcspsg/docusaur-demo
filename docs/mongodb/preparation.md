## 1) Create an Account on MongoDB Atlas

Create an account for yourself on MongoDB's "Atlas" service. You'll be using this service a lot over this module.

https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas

Later we will look at making your own database on this cloud-hosted service

## 2) Install MongoDB Compass

Install the "Compass" software for MongoDB from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass

Download the full version (this will be the default)

### Note for Mac Users

Once downloaded, you cannot simply double-click the download to run it.
Instead:

1. Open finder
2. Navigate to the folder containing the downloaded app
3. Right-click or control-click on it
4. Choose "open" from the pop-up menu
