## 1) Install Postman

Install the software "Postman" for your OS.

https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/

### Issues

If you get

> "error while loading shared libraries: libgconf-2.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

You may first need to run this in the terminal:

`sudo apt-get install -y libgconf-2-4`

### Alternatives

If you have an old computer you might find Postman being very slow or becoming unresponsive. In this case you can try the following alternatives:

- [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.io/): a VS Code extension with very similar user interface to Postman’s
- [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/): a web app with somewhat similar user interface to Postman’s, runs in the browser
