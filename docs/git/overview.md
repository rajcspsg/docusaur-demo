Most software engineers use a tool called Git to organise their code, and collaborate with other people.

Git is a version control tool, used to keep the history of changes, and make collaboration easier. We'll see many of its uses throughout the course.

Each week, you're going to use Git to get a copy of your Coursework exercises, to submit your solutions, and to get feedback on your solutions. Today, you're going to learn how to do these things.

## How is this module delivered?

This module is different to others at CodeYourFuture because some it taught in class and some is assigned as coursework.

These lessons will be assigned at the following times:

- Lesson 1 - Delivered on the first week of the Software Development course
- Lesson 2 - Assigned as Coursework after JavaScript Core 1 Week 3
- Lesson 3 - Assigned as Coursework after JavaScript Core 2 Week 1
- Lesson 4 - Assigned as Coursework after JavaScript Core 2 Week 3

If you want, you can complete the lessons **before** they are given as coursework - but there is no requirement to.
