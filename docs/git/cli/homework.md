## 5) Git CLI Quiz (1 hour)

For this task, you must complete the quiz in the repository and submit it on Github **using ONLY Git CLI**.

This means **you must not open** Github Desktop at all during this task.

You can find the quiz here

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Git-CLI-Coursework

Make sure you clone the repository to your own Github Profile before you start working on this task.

As always, when you submit your work you should mark somebody elses.

## 5) (Optional) Git Ready

We've only taught you the parts of Git that you need to know right now - if you're feeling ambitious take a look at everything else that Git can do

http://gitready.com/

Important: You don't need to know all of this now! Git is a tool you use to solve your problems - you only need to learn as much you need for now.
