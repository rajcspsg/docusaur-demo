6. The "Local Path" input controls where the files will end up on your computer. You can probably leave it as the default
7. Click the Clone button, and wait until it has finished cloning

Congrats! You have successfully cloned a repository from Github! ðŸŽ‰

1. In the menubar, click the Repository option
2. Then click the Open in Visual Studio Code option:

3. Click on the files in the sidebar to see different files. Make sure that you're only changing files that you meant to change
4. Once you're happy with your change, fill out the input boxes in the bottom left to add a _commit message_:

5. Click the "Commit to main" button

You just committed your code to the repository! ðŸŽ‰

You should now see "No local changes". You can now make more changes to the repository (and more commits), or you can push your existing commits.

## I want to send my code to volunteers (Pushing)

Follow these steps if you have committed some code, and want to send it to the volunteers.

3. If this is the first time you have pushed this repository, a message pops up asking if you want to _fork_ this repository. Click the Fork this Repository button:

![Fork this repository](./assets/pushing-2.png)

4. A new message then pops up asking how you are planning to use the fork. Click the "To contribute to the parent project" option, then click Continue:
