## Professional Accounts (2 hours)

Download and install the following software or register for the apps.

Click on the links to go to the registration pages. Keep your login details for all sites/apps consistent and always use your real name.

:::info
CYF recognises you may need to keep your birth name private. When we say real name, we mean the name you go by. It does not have to match your birth certificate or any other legal document. It has to be consistent and professional.
:::

:::tip
CYF understands you may need to keep your picture off the internet. In this case, generate a robohash picture from your name, and use that for all these accounts. Use your robohash consistently and it will help us recognise each other.

### Gmail, Google Account

Make a new Google account. Use your real name. Don’t use any numbers or words that are not your name. Never put the year of your birth in your professional email address. Your email address should look something like this:

> GBencci@example.com

This is your public professional email address. Use it to sign up for all your professional accounts unless you can use your Github. Put it in your Slack profile.

- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have made a professional Google account and Gmail address.
- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have put this in my Slack Profile

### Google Chrome

Google Chrome is the first browser we will all use together.

- <input type="checkbox" checked/>I have downloaded and installed Google Chrome.
- <input type="checkbox" checked/>I have created my professional profile on Chrome.

Use your professional Chrome profile for all your CYF work. You will often have to share your screen during class, so keep your personal internet use private and away from your professional profile.

### Slack

Slack is our community space and how we communicate with each other. Download and install it now.

- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have downloaded the Slack app on my computer and phone
- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have logged in to the Code Your Future Intro to Coding Workspace
- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have found and joined my class channels
- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have updated my profile with my picture and class

### Zoom

We use Zoom for remote weekend classes. Install it now.

- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have downloaded and installed Zoom onto my computer.

### Google Classroom

Google Classroom is where you will find all of your coursework assignments. You will need a Gmail account in order to access Google classroom. Your class code will be posted on Slack.

- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have logged using the Class Code I was given on Slack.
- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have looked around to get to know the interface.

### Miro

Miro is an online whiteboard we sometimes use to share ideas. Register an account now.

- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have signed up for Miro.

### Figma

Figma also has an online jamboard we use to share ideas. Register an account now.

- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have signed up for Figma.

### Code.org

Code.org is a website aimed at helping people learn computer science. You will be doing one of their courses. Register an account now.

- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have signed up for code.org.

### Github

Github is for developers. It's how you will work on code with other developers and where you will build a portfolio of work to show employers. Register an account now.

- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have made a Github account.
- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have used my real name.
- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have not put my birth year in my user name.

Your Github account name should look something like this: https://github.com/SallyMcGrath

When prospective employers are looking at your Github portfolio, you need them to know who you are: not your online identity, but the name you put on your job application. Don’t use cute handles on your Github, even though some mentors do. They are not applying for entry level developer roles.

### LinkedIn

Sign up for Linked In. LinkedIn is the largest professional social network. You will use it to help you get a job and to advance your career.

Make a LinkedIn account. Use your real name. Sign in with Google. Connect with your cohort.

Your cohort is your first network, and this is one of the most valuable things you can develop at Code Your Future. A strong, tightly linked, professional network is a powerful asset, so begin building it today.

- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have made a LinkedIn account using my professional email address
- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have used my real name.
- <input type="checkbox" checked/> I have connected with my cohort
