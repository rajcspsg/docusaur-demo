## Before we start

Download and install MongoDb from <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community>.
Follow the instructions for your platform (Windows, Linux or OS X).

Also download and install _RoboMongo_ from <https://robomongo.org/download>.

Open two instances of terminal.
Run `mongod`â€”this will start MongoDB then run `mongo` on the other window.

In the `mongo` shell (terminal), run the command `version()` and you should get
the version of Mongo printed on the terminal

## Databases overview

> Discussion:
>
> - What is a database role?
> - Why do we need a database? Why not just use the file system?
> - What would make a good database?

## Why a database

- Databases can store very large numbers of records efficiently (they take up
  little space).
- You can have strucutre on your data
- You can query for data in a database, you can sort data, add/edit/delete data
- You can optimise a database to make searches (queries) quicker
- You can relate pieces of data to each other to avoid duplication which makes
  your information more reliable and less prone to errors
- ACID
  > In computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is
  > a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity
  > even in the event of errors, power failures, etc.
- Databases can handle very large data sets.
- Databases are concurrent; multiple users can use them at the same time without
  corrupting the data.
- Databases scale well

## Relational and non-relational databases

There are mainly two flavours of databases used commercially these days.
**Relational** (SQL) and **non-relational** (NoSQL) databases.

Relational databases include MySQL, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle
Database and many others. They've been around for a long time and they're used
for all kind of applications.

Non-relational databases are relatively new and they include the likes of
MongoDB, Casandra, Neo4j etc...

## Mongo

> MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database
> program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like
> documents.

## BSON (JSON-like document)

In a Relational database, information is organised in _rows_ in _tables_ with
predefined _columns_.

In a non-relational database, information is organised in _documents_. MongoDB
stores data records in a format similar to JSON called BSON. BSON is a binary
representation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.

![BSON object](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/_images/crud-annotated-document.bakedsvg.svg)

Let's look at this database table _Students_ containing information about
students participating in a course ![students table](./assets/aws/table-example.png)

> Exercise: What are the columns, rows and tables?

![SQL and MongoDB correspondence](./assets/aws/SQL-MongoDB.png)

> Exercise: Open <https://jsonlint.com/> and write a JSON representation of two
> rows in the Students table example. Click _Validate JSON_ and make sure the
> document is valid.
>
> - Are there any alternative representations you can think of?

**BSON** is very similar to JSON. It contains more data types than JSON, it also
allows the field names to not be quoted. Read more information about the
format: <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/>.

## Mongo Shell

Let's go to `mongo` shell and start interacting with our database system.

### 1. Create a database

On the shell, type the command `use profile` The shell should respond with
**switched to db profile**. At this stage, the database does not necessarily
exist once we start adding information (collections) then the database will be
created and the collection added to them.

To check the current database, run `db`.

### 2. Create a collection

Now let's create our first collection. Make sure you're using the **profile**
database. Run `db` and it should print **profile** on the terminal.

We will insert a simple document representing a student.

> `db.students.insertOne({ name: 'Habiiba', country: 'Somalia', assignedMentors: ['Ashleigh'] })`

You should get a confirmation with the number of records inserted.

You can also insert more than one document at a time. Run this command

> `db.students.insertMany([{ name: 'Khalid', country: 'Yemen' }, { name: 'Yohannes', country: 'Ethiopia', assignedMentors: ['Michael'] }])`

run the command `db.students.count()` and you should get that you have 3
documents.

### 3. Querying data

Querying is one of the most important reasons that we use databases. SQL is the
language used for querying relational databases, In MongoDB, we can use the
method `db.collection.find`, passing a query in the form of a JSON object as a
first parameter.

Let's try few queries:

Get all the students from Ethiopia.

> `db.students.find({country: 'Ethiopia'})`

We can also provide an extra parameter `projection` to define what fields we
want back from the query.

For example, if we're only interested in the name

```js
db.students.find({ country: "Ethiopia" }, { name: 1 });
// you can also use { name: true }
```

Let's add another two students to the collection

`db.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Sudan', assignedMentors: ['Michael'] })`

and

`db.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Syria', assignedMentors: ['Michael', 'Ashleigh'] })`

Now let's query for all the students that have **Michael** as mentor.

```js
db.students.find({ assignedMentors: ["Michael"] });
```

What if we want to find any student whose name is "Mohamed" AND whose country is
"Sudan". You can then use the **logical query operator \$and**.

```js
db.students.find({
  $and: [{ name: "Mohamed" }, { country: "Sudan" }],
});
```

Notice that name and country are case-sensitive.

### Exercise

1. Find all students for whom **Ashleigh** is an assigned mentor.
2. Find all students that have **Michael** as their only mentor
3. Find students whose name is **Mohamed** OR **Michael** is their only mentor
4. Read about the
   [\$in operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/in/#op._S_in)
   and use it to find students whose country is either Sudan or Ethiopia.
5. Look at the other
   [Comparison Query Operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query-comparison/)
   and the
   [Logical Query Operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query-logical/)
   and use few of them.

## Key Concepts so far

In Mongo, a **database** contains **collections** that contain **BSON
documents**. We can use the **mongo shell** to interact with our Mongo
databases. The **query documents** are used to specify a selection filter using
[**query operators**](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/)
to search for documents in the collections.

> Checkpoint: Do you understand all the words highlighed in the last paragraph?

## Node with Mongo

So far we've been connecting to Mongo using the Mongo shell. Mongo has drivers
for most major programming languages but it's especially popular with NodeJS
applications as its API and Query model is very close to JavaScript syntax and
patterns.

Let's start wiring Node with MongoDB as a datastore.

1. Fork and Clone the project
   [https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop).
   run `npm install` then `npm run dev` to run the application with autoreload -
   Go to the browser and make sure it's up and running.

2. Install the MongoDB Node.js Driver `npm install mongodb --save`

3. Let's add an endpoint `api/students` that returns a `json` containing all the
   students that we've been saving to the database from the shell.

Go to the file `controllers/apiController`, on top of the file, require the
module

```js
const MongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient;
```

then add an endpoint for `/students`

```js
router.get("/students", (req, res) => {
  const mongoConnection = "mongodb://localhost:27017/profile";

  MongoClient.connect(mongoConnection, (err, db) => {
    const cursor = db.collection("students").find({});
    cursor.toArray((error, students) => {
      db.close();
      res.json(students);
    });
  });
});
```

Go to your browser `/api/students` and you should see a JSON containing the
documents we've added to the _students_ collection earlier.

> Exercise: Let's step through the previous code and understand it line by line.
>
> - What is a Mongo conection string?

The [connection string](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/)
follows this format:
`mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]`.
What parts do you have in our connection string right now?

### Exercise part 1

Now let's change the `api/posts` to also use the mongo database instead of the
json file under /data.

1. First step is to save the _posts_ in the database. Similar to what we did
   with _students_ collection, use the Mongo shell to create a new collection
   called _posts_ and use **insertMany** to insert all the documents.

2. Change the endpoint `/api/posts` to read its contents from the database (very
   similar code to what we wrote in `/api/students` endpoint). Go to
   `http://localhost:3000/api/posts` and make sure you see the posts. Update a
   document in the database (either check the documentation for
   [update](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/set/#set-top-level-fields)
   or use RoboMongo) and see if it gets reflected.

3. Once you have the endpoint running, delete the json `data/posts.json`.

4. Now if you go to the root of your application `http://localhost:3000`, you
   will encounter an error as it will still try to read from the file system but
   we deleted the file. Update the `/` endpoint to also get the Posts from the
   database.

### Exercise part 2: refactor the code

Even though our code does what's supposed to do, it has several issues. We have
a lot of duplicate codeâ€”both endpoints GET `/api/posts` and GET `/` do the
same call to the database and then do _something_ with it. It's only that
_something_ (the callback) that is different so let's refactor the code to
eliminate duplication (DRY).

1. The variable `mongoConnection` is declared multiple times, that means that if
   the connection string changes then we need to change multiple places causing
   possibilities of missing one instance and causing errors. Let's declare it
   once and use it in the rest of the app.

   - Why is it bad to have duplicate code?

2. Extract the Mongo calls to seperate functions. Extract the route for
   `/api/students` into a function named `getStudents`

   - What will the function signature be?
   - Remember the **Single Responsibility Principle**â€”the route handlers have
     multiple responsibilities right now: Connecting to Mongo, getting the data
     then sending it back as a response.

3. Move the new function to a new file called `helpers/db-client.js`, export the
   functions and use them in the original file.

   - Do you remember how we create modules and use them? `module.exports` and
     `require`.

4. Do the same for the `/posts`

### Exercise Part 3: Deploy our app

Let's deploy our Database-Driven Application to Heroku. If you don't remember
the steps, refresh your memory from
[a previous lesson](/node/week-3/lesson#heroku).

Once you're finished, Go to your application on heroku and see if it is working
properly.

_It should not be working._

Can you have a guess on what went wrong? To see what's happening on the heroku
server, run `heroku logs` from the terminal and check the logs.

## Mongo on Heroku

Heroku, AWS and other cloud services allows us to use databases and other
services on the cloud without having to maintain physical servers making it easy
to scale, monitor costs and build good solutions in general.

We've already used **DynamoDB** on AWS. This week, we'll do **MongoDB**.

1. Go to Heroku dashboard
   [https://dashboard.heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com)

2. Click on your app name in the dashboard. Go to _Resources_, under _addons_,
   search for _mLab MongoDB_ and choose it. When you're prompted with this
   screenâ€”click on **Provision**.

   ![MongoDB on Heroku](./assets/aws/heroku-mongo.png)

   The new MongoDB service will appear under Resources-you can click on it and it
   will take you to a web interface to administer your MongoDB instance.

3. Go to the _Settings_ and click on **Reveal Config Vars**. You should see the
   a variable called MongoDB_URIâ€”that is the connection string for the MongoDB
   instance on Heroku (on mLab used by Heroku).

   > So how can we use this connection string instead of our local one?

## Environment variables

In NodeJS, The `process.env` property returns an object containing the user
environment. Environment variables allow us to configure different aspects of
our application based on the environment where it's runningâ€”so for instance,
when we run our application locally, we want to connect to the local MongoDB but
on Heroku, we want to connect to a different one.

Connection strings are typically saved and used as Environment variables, other
typical uses are with passwords, secrets, URLs of other services etc... Anything
that is environment specific and that shouldn't live in the source code.

> **Security tip**: Never add passwords, connection strings or any sensitive
> information in your source code, always use an Environment variable.

Services like Heroku and AWS can then use these environment variables to
configure aspects of the application.

> We've already used one Environment variable for Heroku beforeâ€”what was it?
>
> Exercise: Use the environment `MongoDB_URI` to connect to MongoDB on Heroku,
> but fallback to **localhost connection string** if there is no environment
> variable provided.

- Commit and push the changes to Heroku and see if it works.
