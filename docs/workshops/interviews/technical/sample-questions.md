# Sample questions for technical interviews

:::danger Warning

## Roman numerals

The Romans used a different number-writing system than we do.

They had some basic numbers:

* `I` is 1
* `V` is 5
* `X` is 10

And to write a number that doesn't have its own symbol, they wrote down numbers that add up to it, in descending order.

For instance, to represent 12, they would write `XII`.

However, to avoid writing down lots of numbers, they didn't write 4 as `IIII`, they wrote it as `IV` (as in, "one less than five").

Your task is to write a function which takes a Roman numeral, and returns the integer it represents.

### Hints

* Some interviewees don't realise that they only need to do a single character of look-ahead when determining whether a number is being subtracted from the following number or not. If they seem stuck on this, give them some examples to nudge them at the idea.

## Longest common prefix

Given an array of strings, return the longest substring that all of the strings start with.

## TODO: Write up more interview questions, and more guidance for asking them.
