## 1) Preparation

This module has some preparation work that should be set as coursework before the module starts

You can find the preparation work [here](./preparation)

## 2) Assessment

All trainees will take an automated assessment on their entry to JS2. This module also has a personal 121 assessment available, which mentors can assign if it's useful to do so.

These assessments should be conducted one-on-one with a mentor (possibly the trainee's buddy). Each of the assessments has a rubric to help you evaluate the code. After completion, the trainee's score should be shared with the Tech Ed team.

The aim of these assessments is:

- Work out how a trainee is doing 121
- Highlight trainees who are falling behind and require help
- Get oversight of any common misconceptions in the class
